# Overview

Hey! I'm Anden, a 23-year-old Software Engineer with predominantly inattentive ADHD. I built this site out to try and help others with the condition.

## Why make this?

It's always been difficult for me to think fast enough in the moment to accurately communicate my condition, so this site is intended to be a thorough, evergreen wiki regarding how it affects me and coping mechanisms I've found useful. My hope is that this will help others with the condition be more productive and get what they want out of life.

Most of the ADHD literature online is also **geared towards children.** A lot of people view it as something you simply grow out of. I never really had a lot of the symptoms (poor test scores, difficulty focusing, poor grades...) throughout high school or college, and only really realized something might be wrong (or had developed) after my sister told me she got diagnosed. 

ADHD is often genetic and I saw a lot of symptom commonality, so I got tested as well. The actual diagnosis is super simple (just a questionnaire), so don't let that stop you from getting diagnosed and getting the treatment you need.

> **I am not a medical professional, but hopefully this is still helpful.** Please don't treat this more than me essentially retelling my experience and what works for me. I don't have it down to a science, but I try. What works for me may not work for you.
