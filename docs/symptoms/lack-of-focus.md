# Lack of Focus

This is obviously one of the most commonly cited symptoms for inattentive ADHD, but I'll talk through my experience with it regardless.

I **really** suck at focusing on any one thing for a sustained period of time.

- My **train of thought** is pretty frequently all over the place. I struggle to keep everything together if I'm trying to make several connected points, and I'll actually very frequently completely forget what I was talking about, especially if I'm actively thinking I'm going to lose my train of thought in the back of my mind. My therapist actually said that my style of talking was one of the most telling things as to whether I have ADHD.
- **I struggle with closing things out.** Especially when it's something I don't like, my brain actively seeks out distraction. This is also why I tend to work on several things concurrently, almost using the others as "breaks" for each other, rather than tunneling on one thing to completion.
