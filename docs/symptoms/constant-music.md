# Constant Music

I listen to music all the time as a background noise kind of thing. It feels weird to just sit and work on something in silence. My Spotify Wrapped was like 99.9th percentile when it came to listening time; think it came out to like 6-7hr of listening time every day or something like that.

Think the logic behind this one is that my brain prefers multiple things going on at once and struggles to focus on one thing at a time.
