# Anxiety

ADHD was actually the cause of quite a lot of anxiety that I had. I've actually been formally diagnosed with anxiety.

The rationale for this essentially stems from this sequence of causation.

- **I suck at keeping my train of thought.** I have a very tangential way of talking because I struggle to keep it all in my head and have things be organized.
- **I struggle to remember things under pressure.** My brain works really slow when it's under pressure to remember something.
- **I get anxiety I won't be able to perform.** Because I have a documented history of forgetting things in the moment, I get anxious it'll happen again.

The fix for this was basically to stop being a perfectionist and to make sure the stakes I was assigning were proportional - read more on the [therapy](../coping/therapy) page.
