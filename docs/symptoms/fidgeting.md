# Fidgeting

I fidget all the time. Jumping my leg up and down, picking my nails, opening and closing my hand, all sorts of things. This is the only real symptom I have that tends towards the hyperactive half of ADHD rather than the inattentive part.

Fidget toys can be a good way to counter this, but I personally don't really view the fidgeting as a problem in the first place, so I don't bother.
