# Lack of Emotions

I'm just fundamentally a pretty unemotional person. I still feel emotions during sad movies and stuff, but in my day-to-day life I actually struggle to feel emotions.

The logic behind this is that, because your brain jumps around all the time, it's difficult to get "attached" to any one emotion. Emotions can't really drive you because they aren't around for long enough to. You always have some monologue of sorts tickling the back of your brain, which ties in heavily with the Anxiety issues I've mentioned elsewhere on the site.

I've legitimately had the thought "What emotion would a normal person be feeling right now" on quite a few occasions. It's like I have to logically *arrive at it* rather than just *feeling it* like a normal person would.
