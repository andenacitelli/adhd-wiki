# Lack of Motivation

This is pretty similar to executive dysfunction, but worth making some distinct points about.

There's a pretty well-known concept out there of people with ADHD having **fixations.** You'll find a few things really interesting and have zero trouble motivating yourself to do those, but anything else that isn't your fixation will be absolute *torture* as far as motivation is concerned.

For me, ADHD basically kills my motivation across the board. I have fixations but tend to get burnt out a bit on them because they tend to overlap with my career quite a bit. Both a curse and blessing - I'm pretty good at my job, but I struggle to find other things to do just because you can only work on something for so long without getting burnt out.
