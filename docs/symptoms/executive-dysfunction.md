# Executive Dysfunction

I usually describe Executive Dysfunction as basically any task I don't want to do requiring more "startup energy" than it really proportionally should. It's like you have a really weird lack of motivation to start doing things. It feels like you have to spend so much more effort to get yourself started.

This has considerable overlap with **motivation.** I used to think I was genuinely depressed because I don't really ever feel *that* strong of a motivation to do anything. However, I think this was basically another pointer towards executive dysfunction and it's an ADHD thing.
