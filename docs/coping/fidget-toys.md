# Fidget Toys

While these have never been particularly useful for me, I've heard they work well for a lot of other people. The general idea with these is to allow your brain a set of distractions that don't actually stop you from getting your work done, but let it get its energy out so that it doesn't force you to distract yourself in a more disruptive way. Would recommend getting one or a few and trying them out.
