# Therapy

Therapy is pretty useful. Having someone to talk to stuff about is nice, and I can't recommend it enough. ADHD manifests in various different ways and was actually a huge part of why I dealt with a lot of anxiety (something I was officially diagnosed with as well).

So, how did I get around it?

## Background

My brain has always worked tragically slow in the moment. My mental function is abhorrent when I'm under any kind of pressure. I didn't know that ADHD was at least partially the cause at the time, but this caused a lot of anxiety around performing and not messing up in the moment.

I would compensate by over-preparing, writing things down for things as simple as a phone call, and much more. I wanted to be "perfect" and never make mistakes.

So, how did I get out of this habit of essentially being a perfectionist?

## Perspective 1: Why are the stakes so high?

The solution here was to reflect on why the stakes were so high. Most things in life simply don't matter whether you mess them up or not, at least in a grand, cosmic sense. 

- With most small things (phone calls, checking out at a register, ...), people won't even remember you the day after, even if you're "weird" or mess something up.
- With important but not ultimately *that* consequential things (a job interview), they do matter, but you have to realize that the majority of what happens is less a function of you performing at that point in time and more about your experience. You can simply be mediocre but have really good long-term work to show off.
- With really important things, you have to kind of realize that even positive outcomes don't necessarily lead to better things. There's always some element of luck and chance that determines who you meet, the opportunities that are available to you, and so on. Why put 

## Perspective 2: Anxiety isn't strictly negative

Another thing that really helped me was internalizing that **anxiety wasn't necessarily negative.** Anxiety is an evolutionary response that simply makes sure we care about the important stuff.

So, internalize just that. Anxiety itself is fine and natural. Just make sure that **anxiety is being ascribed proportionally to how important something actually is**. I would get really anxious about phone calls and all this other nonconsequential stuff when in reality nobody other than you is going to remember that a day later.

## Your brain isn't worse; just different.

Treating ADHD as a strictly negative thing is not quite a recipe for success. While I'd agree that, on average, neurodivergent people tend to struggle more with internalizing behaviors that tend to make people successful people, it's unproductive to view it as "I have ADHD, my brain is worse".

Your brain is just *different.* You might not be able to speak persuasively in the moment, or tunnel on long-term projects and consistently bring them to fruition. However, that might mean that you're better at doing projects in parallel, at managing a bunch of different things at once (especially if, to cope, you did what I did and got really good organizationally), and much more. Lean into those advantages where you can, and truly own the disadvantages, and you'll be at least alright.
