# Removing Distractions

Inattentive ADHD makes it super easy to get distracted. Especially when you're doing something you don't like, your brain will take every opportunity it gets to get distracted.

The fix here is basically to **minimize the distractions around you.** Introduce **as large a barrier as possible** between you and the distractions. Give your brain as few opportunities as possible to latch onto something else.

- **Keep the bare minimum on your desk at work.** The less you see, the fewer opportunities you have for something to snatch your attention.
- **Don't carry your phone around with you.** I've found a good amount of success with wearing a smart watch instead, so that I can still be reachable in emergencies even if I'm not actively keeping an eye on my phone.
- **Do your work away from a bed, if possible.** Especially for those that work remote, this can be really troublesome. It's super easy to jump on your phone and just lay in bed, then you have executive dysfunction to overcome to get back to work.
- **Introduce barriers to your distraction vectors.** Keep the things that distract you away from yourself.
- **Keep other people around.** I feel much more accountable in terms of getting things done if I'm working in the same general space as someone else. Libraries are particularly really good at this; because you aren't home, any distractions you normally seek out have much more of a "barrier" in front of them.

Minimizing phone distraction is detailed enough that [I have a distinct writeup on it](./phone-engineering).
