# Systems

A lot of people with ADHD come into an initial diagnosis appointment and get asked about how they keep organized. People with ADHD consistently have way more systems to stay organized than the "average" person.

I had a micro-fascination of sorts with keeping myself organized. Notion is great software if you're looking for a Wiki; it's what I'd use, and *still* use to keep myself organized. I almost even wrote my own web app to have a fancy prioritization system and all sorts of other bells and whistles.

Point being, don't rely on yourself to just remember stuff. Embed as much into systems as you can so that you don't really have the *option* to forget.

Here's some specific tools and systems you might consider using.

- **Calendar.** Use some kind of calendar to track events and give you reminders when stuff is about to happen. This is the best way to make sure you don't forget about meetings and stuff. I use Google Calendar for this and set up reminders (X minutes before, where X is contextual on the type of event) when relevant, nothing fancy. Many systems like Slack also offer ways to integrate this in so that you get messages when something's about to happen.
- **Task Management.** Use some kind of task management system to keep track of everything and make sure it gets done by the deadline. I use Google Tasks for random, one-off things and a mixture of Jira and Notion for tracking work-related stuff.
- **Pill Minders.** Having a physical device you fill up weekly can be a great way to make sure you're consistently taking your medication. The more times you see it every day, the more likely you are to make it a habit. Put it somewhere out in the open and easily visible; sorry to the interior designers out there, but it's worth the aesthetic hit.
- **Put stuff near bed.** People with ADHD tend to really struggle to wake up in the morning. You can partially fix this by keeping medication or some kind of caffeine right next to your bed to minimize the actual effort necessary to take it. Conversely, putting your phone alarm outside of bed or something, then **finding some way for you to not just go right back to bed**, is another thing to try.
