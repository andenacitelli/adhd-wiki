# External Accountability

With ADHD, you can't rely on motivation or even discipline. You can't necessarily view yourself as someone that can keep themselves truly accountable.

So, delegate that to others where possible. Set your life up so that people depend on you. Set your life up so that other people are actively linked in and are expecting you to do something. Have them check in with you to make sure you got things done.

A good comparison to draw here is to being in school and having assignments due. You have *consequences* if you don't get stuff done, so you get it done. Having external accountability is much more consistent in being able to drive you and get you to complete things.
