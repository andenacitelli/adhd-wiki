# Caffeine

Caffeine is super helpful. As a stimulant, it performs a similar role to a lot of dedicated medications like Adderall/Ritalin/Concerta without having barriers in front of you getting it.

I mix energy powder (any variant w/ caffeine) into some ice water (I'm not a coffee guy) and usually also do another (usually smaller) round around lunchtime. This helps me stop being so goddamn drowsy.

Make sure you're cautious about this, especially when it comes to heart health. Coffee and medication are both generally stimulants, so keep an eye on it and take it slow if you're trying to be on both at once.
