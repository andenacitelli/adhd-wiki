# Minimize Work

Try to avoid creating work for yourself. For a lot of people, it's better to get it done quickly and follow back up on it later, but for us it's probably just best to do it right the first time. Only subject yourself to executive dysfunction once, not twice.

A realistic application of this might be as simple as cleaning up after yourself. If you address something in-the-moment while you've already gotten past the hump that is executive dysfunction, you save yourself an executive dysfunction hit at a later point. **Try not to create work for yourself.**
