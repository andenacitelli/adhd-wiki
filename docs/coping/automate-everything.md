title: Automate Everything

Automating things is really important because it eliminates the need for you to get the "impulse" to do something. It will all just happen automatically.

This can be applied in quite a few ways; here's some examples in my life specifically.

- **Subscriptions.** If there's anything you know you need regularly, set up a subscription that'll automatically get delivered rather than requiring yourself to remember.
- **Get stuff delivered.** Instead of needing to get the impulse to go out to the store, order it and have it delivered. This can be really powerful especially with medications, though admittedly that's not generally an option for controlled substances like stimulants.
