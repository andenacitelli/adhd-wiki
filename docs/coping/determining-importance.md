# Determining Importance

Be proactive about getting things off your plate that aren't actually important. The [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) is a useful application of this, where you evaluate things into four categories based on two metrics - importance and urgent-ness.

If something is both important and urgent, that can stay on your plate. If it's urgent but unimportant, delegate to someone else if it's an option. If it's non-urgent but important, do it yourself. And if it's neither urgent nor important, simply ignore it or delegate it and get it off your plate.
