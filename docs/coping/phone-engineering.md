# Phone Engineering

"Phone Engineering" refers to setting up your phone in a way that makes it more difficult to get distracted by. Your phone is easily the most probable vector for you to get distracted.

Other than keeping it physically distant from yourself to introduce an additional mental barrier to usage, there's quite a few things you can do on your actual phone itself to make things easier.

- **Uninstall most of your apps.** Anything you'd probably label as Social Media (Instagram, ...) or as Entertainment (YouTube, ...) would be my recommendation. The act of uninstalling them doesn't necessarily stop you from reinstalling, but it at least makes the "barrier" to get it back up and running much greater. Attempt to use that executive dysfunction for your own benefit and introduce barriers between yourself and the things that distract you.
- **Optimize your notifications.** 
  - For anything that you don't care about the notifications at *all*, turn them off. 
  - For things you care about but aren't really time-sensitive (email newsletters, ...) set up a notification schedule so that you get them delivered twice a day or something like that.
  - For things that are actually time-sensitive (texts, two factor authentication systems, ...) view them as a necessary evil. You can also experiment with different email inboxes where you only get immediate notifications for some of them, but there's not really a clean way I've discovered to get out of these altogether.
- **Keep your home screen minimal.** This isn't really that consequential, but the phrase "out of sight, out of mind" can be relevant here. If you don't see it, it's harder for you to notice.
- **Minimize marketing emails.** Unsubscribe from any kind of automated email that you can justify.
