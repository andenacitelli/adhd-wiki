# Medication

Medication is likely the most influential of all the coping mechanisms, and something you should absolutely get on if its an option, but unfortunately can be hard for many people to get. 

There are two classes of medication you'd be put on for ADHD - stimulants and non-stimulants.

## Stimulants

Stimulants (Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta, Vyvanse, ...) are by far more effective. Some doctors will start you on non-stimulants and only upgrade you to these if you feel the non-stimulants aren't effective enough.

Some will be very noticeable. My first time on Adderall, I went on a cleaning spree; it was very visible and easy to feel it working. It's like most of the executive dysfunction simply wasn't there. 

Others may be more subtle. I've also been on Concerta (methylphenidate, extended release is the generic) and it still *works*, but it's much harder to tell if it's actually working.

However, stimulants are a controlled substance that require more regular check-ins with your doctor. I've personally been subject to two systems. 

- The first was where I needed to come in, in-person, every three months, with a drug test every six months to make sure you were taking it and not just reselling it (there's a lot of people without ADHD that just use it to help them focus and do homework and stuff).
- The second was fully online, but required check-ins every month with a surprisingly high copay.

Stimulants can sometimes be difficult to find at pharmacies due to the stimulant shortage that's been present the last few years. 

Good news, though - a popular stimulant, Vyvanse, just had its patent expire and generic versions are starting to hit the market, which will hopefully alleviate some of the shortage.

## Non-Stimulants

Nonstimulants (Strattera, ...) are generally the first thing you'll try. They aren't like stimulants where they'll kick in the day you take them. You take them and they gradually build up in your system, so you won't really notice a difference for at least a few weeks.

If they work sufficiently for you, great. They aren't generally controlled, so you can just order these online or whatever. I personally use Amazon Pharmacy when possible; getting these delivered to your door is *huge* as far as your motivation and executive dysfunction is concerned. However, the majority of people (or so I've heard) find these insufficient and graduate to stimulants.

## Side Effects

The only real side effect I've noticed has been a pronounced lack of appetite. Especially with Adderall, but also with Concerta, I would usually get lightheaded before I'd feel hungry. You have to be really intentional about eating to make sure you weren't basically starving your body.

In my opinion, lack of appetite is most definitely worth the advantage of being on medication. Medication makes life easier and is just hugely helpful.
